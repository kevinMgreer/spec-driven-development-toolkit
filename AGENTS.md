# Spec-Driven ATDD Toolkit

This project uses **spec-first Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)**.

> **Golden Rule:** Never write production code unless a failing acceptance test requires it.

Language-agnostic, platform-agnostic. Works in any project — greenfield or legacy. Follows
the [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) standard and is read by Kiro, Copilot, Cursor, Claude, and
any AGENTS.md-aware tool.

## First Action of Any Feature Work (Profile Bootstrap)

Before writing a spec, tests, code, or running quality gates — including ad-hoc requests like
"fix this bug" — **check whether `docs/project-profile.md` exists**.

- **Missing**: your first action is to create it (run Phase 0 — see
  `docs/atdd/workflow.md` § Phase 0 and `docs/atdd/project-detection.md`). Tell the user:
  _"No project profile found — running Phase 0 first so I have an accurate picture of this
  codebase's tooling and conventions."_
- **Exists**: read it first; treat as authoritative.
- **Never** detect tools/conventions on the fly without persisting the profile to disk. Silent
  fallback is why conventions drift between sessions.

---

## The Cycle

```
Analyze → Spec → Tests (Red) → Implementation (Green) → Quality Gates → Refactor → Spec & Doc Sync → PR
```

Never skip or reorder. **Full procedure for every phase is in
[`docs/atdd/workflow.md`](docs/atdd/workflow.md)** — read that file before executing a phase
unless you have it in recent context.

## Hard Rules

- Never write production code before acceptance tests exist and fail (red for the right reason)
- Never modify tests to make them pass — fix the implementation
- Never narrow the spec without confirmation: classify every Phase 6b repair ADDED / MODIFIED /
  REMOVED, and treat a REMOVED (a guarantee the spec no longer promises) as a spec weakening
  that "update the spec to match the code" does not authorize
- Never add logic not demanded by a failing test
- Always update the spec first when requirements change, then tests, then code
- Always re-read `docs/project-profile.md` before Phase 3 and mirror its conventions
- Always read existing project docs (README, CONTRIBUTING, ARCHITECTURE, ADRs) during Phase 0
  — they override inference
- Never proceed past Phase 1 without explicit user approval of the spec — and ask for the
  autonomy level at that same gate, never as a separate question before it
- Never declare done while spec, README, `docs/project-profile.md`, or any doc listed under
  `Sources consulted` in the profile has drift — walk the full list in Phase 6c before
  committing (Phase 6 is a blocking gate, not a recommendation)

## Spec Directory

```
specs/
├── features/       # Gherkin .feature files  — behavior, business-facing
└── technical/      # Markdown technical specs — rules, API contracts, constraints
```

Tag convention: `@smoke` (exactly 1) → `@happy-path` (1–2) → `@edge-case` (2–4) →
`@error` (2–3).

## Spec Change Protocol

Spec → tests → code → docs — in that order. Never update implementation to accommodate new
behavior without updating the spec first. All docs listed under `Sources consulted` in
`docs/project-profile.md` (README, CONTRIBUTING, ARCHITECTURE, ADRs, style guides, etc.) must
be reviewed and updated as part of the change, not as a follow-up. Full protocol in
[`docs/atdd/workflow.md`](docs/atdd/workflow.md) § Spec Change Protocol.
