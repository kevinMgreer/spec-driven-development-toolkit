Address review comments for:

${input}

## Steps

1. **Gather feedback**: Read the PR review comments. Categorize each comment as:
   - **Style/naming** — code style, variable names, formatting (fix directly)
   - **Bug fix** — reviewer found a logic error (fix in implementation, verify tests catch it)
   - **Behavior change** — reviewer wants different behavior (requires spec update first)
   - **Missing coverage** — reviewer wants additional scenarios (add to spec first)
   - **Question** — reviewer asks for clarification (answer in PR comment)

2. **Handle behavior changes** (if any) using the Spec Change Protocol:
   a. Update `specs/features/<name>.feature` first
   b. Update `specs/technical/<name>-spec.md` if needed
   c. Update or add test stubs — confirm they are red
   d. Update implementation — confirm all tests are green
   e. Run quality gates

3. **Handle bug fixes**:
   a. Verify the bug exists (if possible, demonstrate with a failing test)
   b. Fix the implementation
   c. Run tests to confirm the fix
   d. Run quality gates

4. **Handle style/naming feedback**:
   a. Make the requested changes
   b. Run quality gates to confirm nothing breaks

5. **Run all quality gates** after all changes are made.

6. **Commit and push** the changes:

   ```
   fix: address PR review feedback

   - <summary of each change made>
   ```

7. **Report** what was changed and which review comments were addressed.

## Rules

- **Never change behavior** without updating the spec first
- **Never modify tests** to accommodate a code fix — fix the code
- If a reviewer requests behavior that contradicts the spec, flag it and ask: "This would change
  the spec. Should I update the spec to reflect this new requirement?"
- Address ALL review comments — don't leave any unresolved
- Run quality gates after every batch of changes
