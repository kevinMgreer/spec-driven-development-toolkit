Create a pull request for the completed feature:

${input}

## Steps

1. **Verify readiness**: Before creating a PR, confirm:
   - All quality gates pass (`/run-quality-gates`)
   - Spec review passed (`/verify-spec-coverage`)
   - All tests are green

2. **Detect Git state**:
   - Current branch name
   - Default branch (`main` or `master`)
   - Whether there are uncommitted changes
   - Remote name (usually `origin`)

3. **Create a feature branch** (if not already on one):

   ```
   git checkout -b feat/<feature-name>
   ```

   Use the kebab-case feature name from the spec file.

4. **Stage and commit** changes with a meaningful commit message:

   ```
   feat: <short description of the feature>

   Implements specs/features/<name>.feature

   - N scenarios (smoke, happy-path, edge-case, error)
   - All acceptance tests passing
   - Quality gates: lint ✅ format ✅ typecheck ✅ build ✅ tests ✅
   ```

5. **Push** the branch:

   ```
   git push -u origin feat/<feature-name>
   ```

6. **Create the PR** using the GitHub CLI (if available) or provide the URL:
   - **Title**: `feat: <feature description>`
   - **Body**: Include the ATDD checklist from `docs/atdd/checklist.md`, filled in with actual
     paths and check marks for completed items
   - **Labels**: Add relevant labels if the project uses them

7. **Report** the PR URL and summary.
