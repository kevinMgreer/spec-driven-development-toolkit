# Spec-Driven ATDD

Language-agnostic, platform-agnostic spec-first ATDD toolkit.

> **Golden Rule:** Never write production code unless a failing acceptance test requires it.

## First Action of Any Feature Work (Profile Bootstrap)

Before writing a spec, tests, code, or running quality gates — including ad-hoc requests like
"fix this bug" — **check whether `docs/project-profile.md` exists**.

- **Missing**: first action is `/analyze-project` (or Phase 0 of `@atdd-cycle`). Tell the user:
  _"No project profile found — running Phase 0 first so I have an accurate picture of this
  codebase's tooling and conventions."_
- **Exists**: read it first; treat as authoritative.
- **Never** detect on the fly without persisting the profile to disk.

## Directory Structure

```
specs/
├── features/     # Gherkin .feature files (business-facing scenarios)
└── technical/    # Markdown technical specs (API contracts, business rules)
```

## The ATDD Cycle

```
Analyze → Spec → Tests (Red) → Implement (Green) → Quality Gates → Refactor → Spec & Doc Sync → PR
```

Full procedure: **[`docs/atdd/workflow.md`](../docs/atdd/workflow.md)** (read on demand).

## Hard Rules

- Red before green; never modify tests to make them pass
- Never add logic not demanded by a failing test
- Update spec first when requirements change, then tests, then code
- Phase 1 requires explicit user approval before tests are generated
- Phase 3 re-reads `docs/project-profile.md` and mirrors its conventions — no inventing
- Phase 0 reads existing docs (README, CONTRIBUTING, ARCHITECTURE, ADRs) before drawing
  conclusions — they override inference
- Phase 6 (Spec & Doc Sync) is a **blocking** gate that repairs drift in-phase —
  includes `README.md` and `docs/project-profile.md` updates
